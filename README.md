# Tesi
Progetto di tesi Iacovacci:

To-do list:
  
-accuracy distribution for different RTs
  - function(?)
  - keep it between +100 to +500  to avoid the influence of neurons encoding for visual stimuli
  - add comment on how the performance of the simple models on movement prediction can be justified by the fact that neural activity in movement tasks during the preparatory phase to movement can be plotted on the HPA and PEA
    -maybe we could try to distinguish the HPA and PEA populations?   
  
-accuracy distribution for different models I-R
